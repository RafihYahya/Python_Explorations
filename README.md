# Python Explorations: A Project-Based Learning Journey

Welcome to my Python Explorations repository! This project is a collection of hands-on Python exercises designed to build and reinforce programming fundamentals through a series of themed modules.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into modules (`M00`, `M01`, etc.), each containing several exercises (`ex0`, `ex1`, etc.). This structured approach allows for a progressive learning experience, starting with basic concepts and moving toward more complex topics.

## Thematic Learning

The initial modules are centered around a charming "garden" theme. You'll find programs that simulate planting, harvesting, and managing a digital garden. This theme provides a creative and intuitive context for learning core Python concepts, including:

- **Module 00 & 01:** Basic syntax, data types, functions, and an introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with classes like `Plant`, `Flower`, and `Tree`.
- **Module 02:** Robust programming through error and exception handling.
- **Module 03:** Building simple systems like a command-line game, coordinate systems, and inventory management.
- **Module 04:** File I/O, data persistence, and stream management.
- **Module 05:** Advanced OOP concepts, including Abstract Base Classes and data processing pipelines for streaming data.

This project serves as a personal log of my journey through Python, applying concepts to practical, project-based examples.
